All rules are provided in two formats: the `compact' representation
used internally by polyquad and the more common `expanded'
representation.   In the latter format each line of a rule is of the form:

   <x>     <y>     <weight>

or

   <x>     <y>     <z>     <weight>

depending on if the domain is two or three dimensional.  Weights are
specified such that they sum to the volume of the reference domain (as
defined in the paper).  Files are named according to: <strength>-<node
count>.txt.  If, for a given strength q, the number of nodes required
is equivalent to that of the strength q + 1 rule, we omit the strength
q rule.
